# BIG DATA ERA IN GIS
The case study is entitled as **“BIG DATA ERA IN GIS”**. Geographic information system (GIS) is
designed to generate maps, manage spatial datasets, perform sophisticated “what if” spatial analyses,
visualize multiple spatial datasets simultaneously, and solve location-based queries. The impact of
big data is in every industry, including the GIS. spatial data volume, being generated from a wide
variety of sources, the need for efficient storage, retrieval, processing and analyzing of spatial data is
ever more important. Hence, spatial data processing system has become an important field of
research. In recent times a number of Big Spatial Data systems have been proposed by researchers
around the world. Spatial Data or Geo spatial data are increasing day by day generating huge
volume of data from satellite images providing details related to orbit and from other sources for
representing natural resources like water bodies, forest covers, soil quality monitoring etc. This
case study gives the idea to understand GIS data representation, data sets, data sources to provide better
understanding of GIS for analyzing the data using Big Spatial Data.
